 * @description: M-order balance tree has following features
 *               (1) data is on the leaf node
 *               (2) The searching direstion was pointed by M-1 key words on
 *                   non-leaf nodes
 *               (3) The count of Node is between 2 and M whether root or
 *                   leaf nodes;
 *               (4) All of the non-leaf nodes has child node number range from
 *                   M/2 to M, except the root node
 *               (5) All of the leaf node has the same depth, which has between
 *                   L/2 and L items. L is the max count in the leaf
